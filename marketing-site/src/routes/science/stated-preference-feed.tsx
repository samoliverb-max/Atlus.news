    citations: ["S1"] as SourceId[],

  {
    question: "Why do engagement-based feeds make people angry?",
    answer:
      "Because anger and hostility drive engagement. A preregistered audit of Twitter found its engagement algorithm amplified angry, hostile political content compared with a chronological feed, and users said this content made them feel worse about people on the other side.",
    citations: ["S1"] as SourceId[],

  {
    question: "Don't people just want the content they click on?",
    answer:
      "Not always. Research on inconsistent preferences shows that choices made in the moment often differ from what people actually want. When a recommender was tuned to people's ideal preferences, they clicked slightly less but felt better off.",

    question: "Does a stated-preference feed create an echo chamber?",

              A 2026 University of Maryland study of 18–24-year-olds found participants often

              Onboarding asks three things: what you enjoy reading (<strong>Preferences</strong>),
              what you want to understand better (<strong>Goals</strong>), and what you already know
              (<strong>Knowledge</strong>), so we don't repeat it.

            <Feature title="A few picks, then done.">
              Choose Light (1 article), Standard (3) or Deep (5) each day. No infinite scroll.

              Every day mixes <strong>Core</strong> picks close to your interests,{" "}

              <strong>Stated preferences can narrow your view.</strong> In the Twitter study,
              ranking by stated preference cut hostile content, but it did so partly by showing
              fewer posts from people's political opponents.
              <Cite ids={["S1", "S1b"]} /> This is why Atlus builds Stretch and Discovery picks into
              every day.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Twitter experiment was small in scope.</strong> The stated-preference
              ranking re-ordered only about 20 posts per user, so results at full platform scale are
              untested.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Researchers don't say engagement data is useless.</strong> The authors of the
              Twitter study explicitly do not advocate abandoning it. They suggest combining it with
              what users say they want.

            <li>
              <strong>Explaining recommendations isn't proven to keep users.</strong> An
              industry-academic review found no strong evidence that transparency or explanations
              improve retention.
              <Cite ids={["S5b"]} /> We explain our picks because you deserve to know, not because
              it's a growth trick.
